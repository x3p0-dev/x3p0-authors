A customizable authors list block that lets you showcase post authors, their feed links, and post counts.

== Description ==

X3P0: Authors is a block that lets you display a simple list of post authors for your site. This is especially useful if you're coming over from using a classic WordPress theme and need a block that's similar to the old `wp_list_authors()` template tag.

Aside from the full array of normal block design tooks, the block lets you choose from several options:

- **Number:** Decide the number of authors to list.
- **Order By:** Choose from a variety of fields to order the list by.
- **Order:** Whether to display the list in ascending or descending order.
- **Has Published Posts:** Whether to only show authors who have published posts.
- **Show Feed Link:** Whether to show an icon linked to the author's RSS feed.
- **Show Post Count:** Whether to display the author's published post count.
